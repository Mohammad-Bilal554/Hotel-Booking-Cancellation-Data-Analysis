## Process
This analysis of hotel booking cancellations followed a structured approach. Data was acquired from Kaggle. The file was loaded for initial exploration, covering its structure, data types, dimensions, basic statistics, and missing values. This led to a crucial data cleaning and preprocessing phase, addressing missing values, converting data types, and ensuring consistency. Subsequently, new features like room_status and guest_type were engineered for deeper insights. Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was then performed, focusing on is_canceled through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, supported by visualizations. This rigorous EDA helped uncover patterns and relationships, forming the basis for extracting key insights and developing actionable recommendations aimed at reducing cancellation rates and improving hotel operational efficiency and revenue management.

## Final Insights
This project provided valuable insights into the factors driving hotel booking cancellations. A key finding is the significant impact of room assignment discrepancies, where guests are not given their reserved room type. This often leads to dissatisfaction and subsequent cancellations, highlighting the need for improved room allocation and proactive guest communication. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that cancellation rates can vary considerably by the guest's country of origin and guest type, suggesting that a one-size-fits-all approach to booking policies may be inefficient. Different guest segments and geographical regions exhibit unique cancellation behaviors, necessitating tailored strategies.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, by leveraging data from the given <a href="https://github.com/Mohammad-Bilal554/Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Hotel_Booking_Cancellations_Analysis.xlsx">dataset</a>, we can move beyond reactive measures to a proactive approach in managing cancellations. Implementing solutions such as optimizing room assignment processes, offering flexible or stricter policies based on guest origin and type, and strategically using tiered cancellation deadlines can significantly reduce revenue loss. This analysis underscores the importance of a data-driven approach to understand guest behavior and refine operational strategies, ultimately leading to improved guest satisfaction and enhanced profitability for hotels.
