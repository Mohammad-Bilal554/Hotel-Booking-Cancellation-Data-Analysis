## Process Section
This analysis of hotel booking cancellations followed a structured approach. Data was acquired from Kaggle. The file was loaded for initial exploration, covering its structure, data types, dimensions, basic statistics, and missing values. This led to a crucial data cleaning and preprocessing phase, addressing missing values, converting data types, and ensuring consistency. Subsequently, new features like room_status and guest_type were engineered for deeper insights. Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was then performed, focusing on is_canceled through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, supported by visualizations. This rigorous EDA helped uncover patterns and relationships, forming the basis for extracting key insights and developing actionable recommendations aimed at reducing cancellation rates and improving hotel operational efficiency and revenue management.
